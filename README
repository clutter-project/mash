Mash - README
===============================================================================

Mash is a small library for using real 3D models within a Clutter
scene. Models can be exported from Blender or other 3D modelling
software as PLY files and then used as actors. It also supports a
lighting model with animatable lights.

REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mash currently requires:

  â€¢ Clutter >= 1.2.0

Mash can also optionally depend on Mx >= 1.1.0. This is only used in
the lighting example so it is not neccessary for the library.

For lighting, Mash requires GLSL shader support.
