Mash 0.2.0
==========

New features since 0.1.0:

 • MashLightBox has changed to be a generic object so the lights don't
   have to be a direct descendant of any particular actor. The
   MashModel actors are now aware of lighting and set up their own
   Cogl material based on the lighting parameters instead of assuming
   the MashLightBox will install a global shader. This has changed the
   API for using lights quite a lot but it is more flexible and it
   ends up using Cogl more efficiently.

 • The code has been refactored so that in future it can support more
   file formats than just PLY. However there is currently no other
   loaders yet.

 • The lighting shaders are now compatible with GLES2.
